Summary of the simple_shell reposirory

The repository is a base for a team project
to create a program that emulates a command line
interpreter that reads input/output from commands
that return a particular status. The programming
language used to develop program emulation is the
C language. The simple shell program communicates 
with the kernals systems and hardware for interactive
and non-interactive use.
